# Machine Learning for Medical Images Project: Coronary Artery Segmentation and Tree Graph Representation

## Overview
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death worldwide, often resulting from the narrowing (stenosis) of arteries due to atherosclerotic plaque buildup. Accurate vessel segmentation from computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans is essential for diagnosis, but manual annotation is time-consuming and prone to variability.

This project presents a **machine learning–based pipeline** for automated coronary artery segmentation and **tree graph representation** of the artery structure, enabling faster, reproducible, and advanced vessel analysis.

## Project Goals
1. **Task 1: Automated Segmentation** – Extract coronary arteries from CTA images using deep learning.
2. **Task2: Tree Graph Construction** – Convert segmentation masks into a structured graph for quantitative analysis.

## Features
- Fully automated pipeline with minimal human intervention.
- Graph-based analysis of artery topology.
- Extraction of vessel metrics (branch depth, length, etc.).
- Detection of incomplete or irregular artery structures.
