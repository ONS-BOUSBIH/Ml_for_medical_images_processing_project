Machine Learning for Medical Image processing : Coronary Artery Segmentation and Tree Graph Representation

Overview
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, often resulting from the narrowing (stenosis) of coronary arteries due to atherosclerotic plaque buildup. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment, and coronary artery segmentation from medical imaging plays a vital role in this process.

Manual segmentation, however, is time-consuming and subject to inter-clinician variability. This project leverages machine learning to build an automated coronary artery segmentation pipeline from computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans, aiming to improve efficiency, reproducibility, and diagnostic support.

Project Goals
This project focuses on two main tasks:

Coronary Artery Segmentation – Automatically extracting coronary arteries from CTA images using deep learning.

Tree Graph Representation – Converting segmentation masks into a structured graph of the coronary artery tree for further quantitative analysis.

Features
Automated Segmentation – Minimal human intervention required.

Graph-Based Analysis – Representation of arteries as a tree graph structure.

Metric Extraction – Calculation of branch depth, length, and other key vessel parameters.


Motivation
By automating coronary artery segmentation, physicians can focus on analyzing complex cases instead of spending hours on manual annotation. This approach also reduces human error and enhances the reproducibility of results.

Potential Applications
Clinical diagnosis support for CAD.

Quantitative vessel analysis for research.

Basis for automated stenosis detection systems.
